ACF Custom Field Enabler


== Overview ==
The ACF Custom Field Enabler is a WordPress plugin designed to address a specific issue with Advanced Custom Fields (ACF). ACF is a powerful tool for adding custom fields to WordPress, but it has a behavior of turning off the standard custom fields in certain situations. This can be inconvenient for users who want to utilize both ACF and the default custom fields simultaneously.

The ACF Custom Field Enabler resolves this issue by providing a simple solution to enable the standard custom fields that ACF might be turning off. This plugin is ideal for users who rely on both ACF and the default custom fields in their WordPress projects.

== Features ==
Enable Standard Custom Fields: The primary function of this plugin is to enable the standard custom fields that ACF may be disabling.

Easy Integration: The ACF Custom Field Enabler seamlessly integrates into your WordPress environment without requiring complex configurations.

Lightweight: The plugin is designed to be lightweight, ensuring that it doesn't add unnecessary overhead to your WordPress site.

==Installation==
